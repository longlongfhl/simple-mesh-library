# SML - A Simple Mesh using Library #


---


## SML tends to be a simple half edge based meshes library. ##

It is based on the GMTools library developped by Dimitri Kudelski which was written in c.

The code tends to be more readable than efficient.
The library architecture is planned to evolve within the enhancement of (and the add of tools to) the library. For example : it will be possible to include only the kernel of the library, and no parts using the OpenGL or GLUT lib.

You will find the source code, some examples and the documentation ion this depository.



Please see the [README](https://code.google.com/p/simple-mesh-library/source/browse/trunk/Documentation/readme.txt) for first informations.

**The library is still in development**
